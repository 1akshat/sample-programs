No tutorial would be complete at this point without a little bit of Wikipedia research.

According to Wikipedia, PHP is a server-side scripting language developed around the 
same time as JavaScript in 1995. Back then, PHP was designed to help with maintaining 
personal home pages which is how the language got its name.

Today, PHP is used all over the web for website backends. In other words, PHP generally 
handles all the heavy lifting like database management and HTML generation. Meanwhile, 
our old friend JavaScript handles the interactive elements on the frontend.

In terms of features, PHP is fairly limited. After all, PHP was based on C, so the syntax 
tends to be similar. That said, PHP does offer some core libraries that make sense for web 
development. For instance, PHP includes functionalities for hashing, json, xml, and glob.

Regardless, PHP still takes a lot of criticism. Much like JavaScript, PHP is often mocked 
for its inconsistency and brokenness. And, the hilarious part is that both languages dominate 
the web.
